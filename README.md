# Corithun-s-Thumbnail-Gen
An open-source way to generate goofy thumbnails.


How to use:


For previewing how this works in a lightweight version go to: 
https://corithun.w3spaces.com/

The Python repository, however, is able to instantly be used, the images that are used as examples are available, but never need
to be named, just in their respective (people) and (people_backgrounds) folders.


The expected  customization option is to seperate various parts of an image into layers, and images that could be swapped with
another of their kind be put in the (people)(FOR TOP LAYER OBJECTS) and (people_backgrounds)(FOR BACKGROUNDS).


The python file should be stored in one directory among the other files, in which it can create the (thumbnail_img) folder.
Like so:


/..........


 generator.py

 
 people

 
 ....1.png - etc

 
 people_backgrounds

 
 ....1.png - etc
